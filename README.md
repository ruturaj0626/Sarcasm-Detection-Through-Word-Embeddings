## About

In this repository, we tackle the challenging task of sarcasm detection by harnessing the power of word embeddings and machine learning. Sarcasm often relies on subtle linguistic cues, and our goal is to build accurate models that can identify these cues within text data.

## Key Features

### 1. Word Embeddings

We leverage state-of-the-art word embeddings, including Word2Vec, GloVe, and fastText, to capture nuanced semantic information from text. These embeddings form the foundation for understanding the context and nuances of sarcastic expressions.

### 2. Machine Learning Models

Our repository contains a diverse set of machine learning models, ranging from traditional methods like Support Vector Machines (SVM) to cutting-edge deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers. These models are fine-tuned and optimized for sarcasm detection tasks.

### 3. Datasets

We provide access to meticulously curated datasets containing samples of both sarcastic and non-sarcastic text. These datasets are invaluable for training and evaluating sarcasm detection models across various contexts.

### 4. Evaluation Metrics

We offer evaluation scripts and metrics for assessing the performance of sarcasm detection models. Precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy are among the metrics you can use to evaluate model effectiveness.

### 5. Visualization Tools

Visualizations of word embeddings and model predictions are available to provide insights into how the models operate and make predictions.

### 6. Tutorials and Documentation

Comprehensive tutorials and documentation are included to guide you through the process of building, training, and evaluating sarcasm detection models using word embeddings.
